# Surfs_up

## Overview
W. Avy wants more information to determine if he should open a surf and ice cream shop and if it would be sustainable year-around. In order to determine this, he wants to compare the temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu.

## Results
### June Statistics for Temperature and Visualization

__Key Differences in Weather in Oahu, Hawaii__

- The average recorded temperature in June is 75 degrees F compared to the average recorded temperature of 71 degrees F in December.
- The frequency of temperatures recorded in June has a more normal bell curve distribution
- Looking at the December temperatures there is a larger range in recorded temperatures compared to June. With that being said, the median temperature in December is more inline with the avaerge.

## Summary
After reveiwng the data and visualizations, I can determine that have a surf and ice cream shop year-around would be good idea based on just the temperature. The average temperatures for June and December only differ by 4 degrees. Even though it looks like the temperatures in December vary more than those in June, there looks like there will still be a demand for surfing and ice cream during the month of December. 

I would want to perform some additional queries to get more information about the weather conditions for these two months.

1. I would like to look into the statistics of temperatures recorded by each station for each month. This will help dteremine where on Oahu would be the best for the shop. Comparing the differences in temperatures and the frequencies recorded, a optimal location can be narrow down.

2. Secondly, I would like to review other variables like precipitation and other factors that can help determine the best location for the shop. Choosing an area that has optimal surfing and beach conditions. Just relying on the temperatures is foolish as there are many other factors that can correlate with the amount of foot traffic a beach will see on a given day.
